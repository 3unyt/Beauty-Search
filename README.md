Final Report: [CS6200_Final_Report_yuting.pdf](./documents/CS6200_Final_Report_yuting.pdf)



## Run this project
* Run Elasticsearch in elasticsearch directory: `bin/elasticsearch`.

* If you run this app for the first time, run `python beauty_search.py` to index. The indexing process takes approximately one minute. Once the data is indexed, it does not need to be re-indexed.

* Run flask app: `python main.py`.

* Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and have fun!
